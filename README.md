📚 About This Repository

This repository acts as my personal learning journal as I strengthen my foundations in PyTorch, deep learning, and neural network implementation.

Inside each folder, you'll find:

📘 Jupyter Notebooks / Python scripts with clear, step-by-step implementations

🧩 Concept breakdowns and explanations in simple language

💡 Code comments, experiments, and observations

📊 Mini projects and guided exercises based on Daniel’s teachings

🧠 My Learning Goals

Build a solid understanding of PyTorch fundamentals.

Learn how to design, train, and optimize neural networks effectively.

Apply deep learning concepts to practical, real-world projects.

Write clean, understandable, and modular code.

Maintain consistent progress and organize everything clearly on GitHub.
